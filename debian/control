Description: library for multidimensional numerical integration
 The Cuba library offers a choice of four independent routines for
 multidimensional numerical integration: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and
 Cuhre.  They work by very different methods, first three are Monte Carlo
 based. All four have a C/C++, Fortran interface and can integrate vector
 integrands. Their invocation is very similar, so it is easy to substitute
 one method by another for cross-checking. For further safeguarding, the
 output is supplemented by a chi-square probability which quantifies the
 reliability of the error estimate.

 This package contains the header file and the static library.

Package: cuba-partview
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: partition viewer for the Cuba library
 Partview reads Cuba's verbose output from stdin and displays the
 specified planes of the tessellation on screen.  Each pair of dimensions
 is shown in a separate tab.
